I am currently completing my PhD, at the [University of the Free State (UFS)](https://www.ufs.ac.za/homepage) in South Africa. I am focusing on soybean and sunflower stem and head rot, caused by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. I am under the supervision of Professor Neal McLaren and Professor [Emerson Del Ponte](http://www.delponte.netlify.com), [Universidade Federal de Vi√ßosa (UFV)](https://www.ufv.br/international-students/), in Brazil. I enjoy doing the data science components of my research and getting out into the fresh air to conduct our field trials.   

I am a contracted academic staff member, teaching an Introductory Plant Pathology course as well as an honours course in an Introduction to Plant Disease Epidemiology. I currently supervise two postgraduate students, at MSc and PhD level. I am the Principle Investigator in my division for Plant Disease Epidemiology. Our research group focus on Sclerotinia diseases of oilseed crops and sorghum foliar and grain diseases.  

I have taught myself how to use R and R-studio, under the guidance of my co-supervisor and lab mates at the UFV. I am encouraging my post-graduates to do the same. I provide them with guidance but promote self-learning as this is a heuristic process.   

Outside of my academic work, I am also the Blog and Social Media Editor for [Open Plant Pathology](www.plantpathology.org).  I am passionate about Open Science and Reproducible Research.
