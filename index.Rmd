I have completed my PhD in Plant Pathology, at the [University of the Free State (UFS)](https://www.ufs.ac.za/homepage) in South Africa. I am focused my research on soybean and sunflower stem and head rot, caused by _Sclerotinia sclerotiorum_. I was under the supervision of Professor Neal McLaren (UFS) and Professor [Emerson Del Ponte](https://github.com/emdelponte), [Universidade Federal de Vi√ßosa (UFV)](https://www.ufv.br/international-students/), in Brazil. 

I am currently a contracted academic staff member, teaching an Introductory Plant Pathology course as well as an honours course in an Introduction to Plant Disease Epidemiology. I currently supervise three postgraduate students, at MSc and PhD level. I am the Principle Investigator in my division for Plant Disease Epidemiology. Our research group focus on Sclerotinia diseases of oilseed and -protein crops and sorghum foliar and grain diseases.  I enjoy doing the data science components of my research and getting out into the fresh air to conduct our field trials.   

I have taught myself how to use R and R-studio, under the guidance of my co-supervisor and lab mates at the UFV. I am encouraging the post-graduates under my supervisions to do the same. I provide them with guidance but promote self-learning as this is a heuristic process.  

Outside of my academic work, I am also the Blog and Social Media Editor for [Open Plant Pathology](https://openplantpathology.org/).  I am passionate about Open Science and Reproducible Research.  In 2021, I will start as an Assistant Editor at [_Phytopathology_](https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/journal/phyto). I am looking forward to this opportunity to participate actively in my research discipline.
