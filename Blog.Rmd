## "Tussen Takk" - _a thousand thank you's_ 

### 24-04-2020

#### Lisa A. Rothmann 

Although, this website is the first and most likely not the last, I owe a huge thank you to many for teaching me, remotely. I wanted to get something "on paper"  for my 30th birthday, which was yesterday, and thanks to the kind nature of the `rstats` community I could start.   

My first blog post is an acknowledgement to those who share and contribute to teaching materials.   

These are the resources which I used to get this first platform up and running, in no particular order: 
* [Lowndes,J. 2016. Making free websites with RStudioâ€™s R Markdown](https://jules32.github.io/rmarkdown-website-tutorial/)
* [Zabor, E. 2018. Creating website in R](https://www.emilyzabor.com/tutorials/rmarkdown_websites_tutorial.html)
* [Xie, Y., Allaire, J.J. & Grolemund, G. 2020. R Markdown: The Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/rmarkdown-site.html)
* [Holtz, Y. 2018. Pimp my rmd.](https://holtzy.github.io/Pimp-my-rmd/#text_formating) _specifically for the tips on the  footer_ 

I hope that I can continue to grow and spread the rstats community encouragement.   
Until next time,
Blessings.
