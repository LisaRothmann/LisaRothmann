In this filing cabinet I am going to curate my ramblings and internet discoveries, to pay homage to all those who contribute to my learning and share with others the wonders of science.

## "Tussen Takk" - _a thousand thank you's_

Although, this website is the first and most likely not the last, I owe a huge thank you to many for teaching me, remotely. I wanted to get something "on paper"  for my 30th birthday, which was yesterday, and thanks to the kind nature of the `rstats` community I could start.   

My first blog post is an acknowledgment to those who share and contribute to teaching materials.   

These are the resources which I used to get this first platform up and running, in order of finding them on my learning journey:   
1. [Pritchard, A. 2017. Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)     
2. [Bryan, J. & Hester, T. 2020. Using Git and GitHub with R, Rstudio, and R Markdown.](https://happygitwithr.com/)   
3. [Lowndes, J. 2016. Making free websites with RStudioâ€™s R Markdown](https://jules32.github.io/rmarkdown-website-tutorial/)  
4. [Zabor, E. 2018. Creating website in R](https://www.emilyzabor.com/tutorials/rmarkdown_websites_tutorial.html)  
5. [Xie, Y., Allaire, J.J. & Grolemund, G. 2020. R Markdown: The Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/rmarkdown-site.html)  
6. [Holtz, Y. 2018. Pimp my rmd.](https://holtzy.github.io/Pimp-my-rmd/#text_formating) _specifically for the tips on the  footer_  

I hope that I can continue to grow and spread the `rstats` community encouragement.   

Until next time,  
Blessings.
