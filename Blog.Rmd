## “Tussen Takk” - a thousand thank you’s  
24-04-2020  
Lisa A. Rothmann  

Although, this website is the first and most likely not the last, I owe a huge thank you to many for teaching me, remotely. I wanted to get something “on paper” for my 30th birthday, which was yesterday, and thanks to the kind nature of the rstats community I could start.  

My first blog post is an acknowledgement to those who share and contribute to teaching materials.  

These are the resources which I used to get this first platform up and running, in order of finding them on my learning journey:  
1. Pritchard, A. 2017. Markdown Cheatsheet.  
2. Bryan, J. & Hester, T. 2020. Using Git and GitHub with R, Rstudio, and R Markdown.  
3. Lowndes, J. 2016. Making free websites with RStudio’s R Markdown  
4. Zabor, E. 2018. Creating website in R.  
5. Xie, Y., Allaire, J.J. & Grolemund, G. 2020. R Markdown: The Definitive Guide.  
6. Holtz, Y. 2018. Pimp my rmd. specifically for the tips on the footer.  

I hope that I can continue to grow and spread the rstats community encouragement.  

Until next time,  
Blessings.
