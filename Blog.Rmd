## “Tussen Takk” - a thousand thank you’s  
24-04-2020  
Lisa A. Rothmann  

Although, this website is the first and most likely not the last, I owe a huge thank you to many for teaching me, remotely. I wanted to get something “on paper” for my 30th birthday, which was yesterday, and thanks to the kind nature of the rstats community I could start.  

My first blog post is an acknowledgement to those who share and contribute to teaching materials.  

These are the resources which I used to get this first platform up and running, in order of finding them on my learning journey:  
1. [Pritchard, A. 2017. Markdown Cheatsheet.](https://github.com/wptrainingteam/markdown-cheatsheet)  
2. [Bryan, J. & Hester, T. 2020. Using Git and GitHub with R, Rstudio, and R Markdown.](https://happygitwithr.com/)  
3. [Lowndes, J. 2016. Making free websites with RStudio’s R Markdown.](https://jules32.github.io/rmarkdown-website-tutorial/)  
4. [Zabor, E. 2018. Creating website in R.](https://www.emilyzabor.com/tutorials/rmarkdown_websites_tutorial.html)  
5. [Xie, Y., Allaire, J.J. & Grolemund, G. 2020. R Markdown: The Definitive Guide.](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/)  
6. [Holtz, Y. 2018. Pimp my rmd. specifically for the tips on the footer.](https://holtzy.github.io/Pimp-my-rmd/) 

I hope that I can continue to grow and spread the rstats community encouragement.  

Until next time,  
Blessings.
