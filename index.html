<p>I am currently completing my PhD, at the <a href="https://www.ufs.ac.za/homepage">University of the Free State (UFS)</a> in South Africa. I am focusing on soybean and sunflower stem and head rot, caused by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. I am under the supervision of Professor Neal McLaren and Professor <a href="http://www.delponte.netlify.com">Emerson Del Ponte</a>, <a href="https://www.ufv.br/international-students/">Universidade Federal de Vi√ßosa (UFV)</a>, in Brazil. I enjoy doing the data science components of my research and getting out into the fresh air to conduct our field trials.</p>
<p>I am a contracted academic staff member, teaching an Introductory Plant Pathology course as well as an honours course in an Introduction to Plant Disease Epidemiology. I currently supervise two postgraduate students, at MSc and PhD level. I am the Principle Investigator in my division for Plant Disease Epidemiology. Our research group focus on Sclerotinia diseases of oilseed crops and sorghum foliar and grain diseases.</p>
<p>I have taught myself how to use R and R-studio, under the guidance of my co-supervisor and lab mates at the UFV. I am encouraging my post-graduates to do the same. I provide them with guidance but promote self-learning as this is a heuristic process.</p>
<p>Outside of my academic work, I am also the Blog and Social Media Editor for <a href="www.plantpathology.org">Open Plant Pathology</a>. I am passionate about Open Science and Reproducible Research.</p>
