<h2>Communicating and contributing to science.</h2>
<p>Prepared by Lisa Rothmann for PPLG2624 presented at the University of the Free State, Plant Science: Plant Pathology, prepared on 2020-10-02. Published on this website on 2020-11-05.</p>
<div id="science-communication" class="section level3">
<h3>Science communication</h3>
<p>Sir Mark Wright said, “science isn’t finished until it is communicated.” Scientific communication (SciCom) as defined by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/09636625030122004">Burns <em>et al.</em> (2003)</a> as “the use of appropriate skills, media, activities, and dialogue to produce one or more of the following personal responses to science.” SciCom has many aims or purposes, which is related to the participants who are involved in the dialogue, whether it be researchers, mediators, members of the public, and interactions can occur within and between groups too <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/09636625030122004">(Burns <em>et al.,</em> 2003)</a>. The aims of SciCom include, but are not limited to; i) sharing recent and exciting findings, ii) raising awareness of science iii) fostering public appreciation for science iv) stimulating inclusive perspectives on and in science and v) engaging with policymakers, vi) build trust between science and the public <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fcomm.2019.00055">(Kappel &amp; Holmen, 2019)</a>, vii) embracing or challenging the impacts science has on society and viii) find enjoyment or appreciating science as art or entertainment <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/09636625030122004">(Burns <em>et al.,</em> 2003)</a>. These aims can be achieved through many platforms and methods driven by the defined aim and participants. The manner of SciCom which we are going to be focusing on in PPLG2624 is Scientific Reporting. This is one of the primary manners scientists disseminate their protocols and results, recently statistical code and data are incorporated into scientific papers too.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-is-a-scientific-report" class="section level3">
<h3>What is a scientific report?</h3>
<p>Upon the completion of a research project, the work is presented in a written manuscript, (usually) peer-reviewed and published in academic journals, and other platforms of course. These articles form the basis of dissemination the contents of the study but also validating or refuting the evidence presented <a href="https://doi.org/10.3108/beej.2003.01010010">(Willmott <em>et al.,</em> 2003)</a>. There is a general outline for the content of a scientific report, these are usually (in the order of appearance) the; Title as well as the authors and affiliated institutions, Abstract, Introduction, Method &amp; Materials, Results, Discussion, Conclusion, References and sometimes or usually Acknowledgements.</p>
<p>This instructonal piece was inspired by <a href="https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/bes2.1258">Turbek <em>et al.</em> (2016), Scientific Writing Made Easy: A Step- by- Step Guide to Undergraduate Writing in the Biological Sciences</a>, please take the time to read this and appreciate the efforts made by the authors.</p>
<div id="title-authorship-and-institutions" class="section level4">
<h4>Title, Authorship and Institutions</h4>
<p>A title needs to be concise - short but still provide enough relative information, with keywords of the work conducted. Authors are encouraged to publish under the same name and are usually listed in the order of their contribution. The institution of involvement is provided for each author, as well as the corresponding author’s contact details are provided <a href="https://www.waikato.ac.nz/library/guidance/guides/write-scientific-reports">(The University of Waikato, 2020)</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="abstract" class="section level4">
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>They say first impressions last - after a title has caught the attention of a reader it is the ‘responsibility’ of the abstract to retain the reader’s interest and pull them in to read the entire article. <a href="https://doi.org/10.14661/2012.520-524">Jalalian (2012)</a> state that an abstract performs three critical tasks; i) addressing the intention of the study, ii) summarising the results and iii) the impact of these findings. Abstracts are usually a maximum of 600 words, but this can vary between Journals and usually do not include references. Keywords are also presented at the end of an abstract, these are usually not words used in the title, but are needed to guide readers to your article.</p>
</div>
<div id="introduction" class="section level4">
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>There are three key components in writing a great introduction, i) providing sufficient background information on the topic, ii) specifying how the work conducted fits in with the field of study and fills knowledge gaps and iii) stating the hypothesis or research aim of the study. In-text references will be used in this section and the following sections, these are usually either in one of the following formats; i.e. (Surname, Year) or (Surname 1 and Surname 2, Year) or (Surname <em>et al.,</em> Year) and Surname, (Year) or Surname 1 and Surname 2 (Year) and Surname <em>et al.</em> (Year).</p>
</div>
<div id="materials-and-methods" class="section level4">
<h4>Materials and Methods</h4>
<p>The key function of this section is to enable a reader to replicate and reproduce the study you conducted, this means the procedures need to be structured, clear and comprehensive. The experimental design and details of protocols followed for field trials or surveys, glasshouse and laboratory procedures are reported here, as well as the analytical framework implemented on the data collected through the above approaches. Materials and methods are written in the past tense and in the passive voice. Some researchers share the statistical code which they used as well, this is integrated into a Research Compendium, which is known to enable computational reproducibility. All established protocols are referenced and if any changes are made these alterations are also stated and cited.</p>
</div>
<div id="results" class="section level4">
<h4>Results</h4>
<p>The key findings of the study are presented in the results of a paper, providing a sequential and concise flow of the data interpretation as the materials and methods were presented. The results need to be specific and briefly related back to the biology of the finding, with a reference to statistical significance if appropriate. The results need to be an objective overview of the study, the discussion will provide the author with the opportunity to interpret the findings.</p>
</div>
<div id="discussion" class="section level4">
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>The discussion is usually initiated by stating whether or not the aim or hypothesis was met or refuted. The results are interpreted here and should allow for the reader to consider potential reasons for the outcome of particular results. References which supported the findings as well as potentially explain why results may not corroborate with the “normal” or expected results are provided. Additionally, recommendations for improvement or future research opportunities can be discussed.</p>
</div>
<div id="conclusion" class="section level4">
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>This section is usually a short paragraph or a few closing sentences which highlight the impact of the study and how it contributes to the scientific body of knowledge in which the research is participating. It is the golden thread which ties all of the components of the study together.</p>
</div>
<div id="references" class="section level4">
<h4>References</h4>
<p>The work conducted in your study would not be able to be completed if it were not for previous researchers, this section you cite in full the references you made use of in your text. There is usually a formatted style which is required by different journals (or in this case, your lecturer or supervisor). You also need to make sure all the references align between those in-text and full in your bibliography. There are many useful tools or software which can assist you in automating your in-text references and full reference list, these include Endnote, Mendeley and Zotero. I make use of Zotero, because it integrates nicely with Google Docs, where I do my writing, ensuring my work is backed up on my Google Drive.</p>
</div>
<div id="acknowledgements" class="section level4">
<h4>Acknowledgements</h4>
<p>This is a place to thank people or institutions who contributed significantly to the project, either through financial, infrastructural, staff and peer-reviewing contributions, for example.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="so-you-have-structure-what-about-the-overall-impression" class="section level3">
<h3>So, you have structure, what about the overall impression?</h3>
<p>Grammar, vocabulary and spelling used should be neat and interpretable, so not to impose on the reader’s ability to understand what is trying to be communicated. There needs to be flow in arguments and thoughts presented, ensuring sentence structure is emphasising the correct concept. Ultimately, the reader should want to read what is presented, their curiosity should be peaked and they should want to tell others to read your work too.</p>
